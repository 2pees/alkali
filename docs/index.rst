alkali
======

Alkali, or AlkiDB, is a database engine.

If you know anything about databases then you know that any real
database is ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolation, Durable). If you know
anything about chemistry then you know that an alkaline substance is the
opposite of an acidic one.

I think you can see where this is going.

So _alkali_ is basically the opposite of an ACID database. Except of
Durable. If _alkali_ is not durable then we want to hear about it as
soon as possible.

So knowing this, why would you use _alkali_? If you need a simple
database-like library and especially if you want to control the on-disk
format of your database then _alkali_ just might be for you.

If you're at all familiar with Django ORM or SQlAlchemy then _alkali_'s
API will feel very comfortable.
